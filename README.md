### discourse-forcemoderation

This Discourse plugin lets you force all posts by particular, named users to go through moderation.

This is useful if you don't want to make all Trust Level 0 users go through moderation but have
someone whose posts aren't completely worthless all of the time but need filtering to reduce
annoyance and disruption.
